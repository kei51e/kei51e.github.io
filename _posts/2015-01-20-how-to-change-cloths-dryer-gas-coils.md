title: How to change cloths dryer gas coils
---

This article talks about the cloths dryer problem that I had and
how I got this fixed by myself.

## The problem

I had a problem with my 12-year-old cloths dryer. Every time I used the dryer,
it heated up ok for the first 5-10min but then it went cold, and it took a very long time to dry.
I googled it and it looks like a gas coil problem. Ok... but, what is a gas coil???

The next thing I googled was approximately how much it costs if I call for repair.
Someone said **$800**, the other one said **$1100**.
I also checked out the price of gas coils, and it was around **$10** for a pair.
So, I decided to repair by myself.  

## My dryer's make and model

Maytag Neptune Super Stack MLG2000AWW

If you own the same one and you are having the same problem,
you are lucky! It should be easy to fix!

## What you need to fix

* New gas coils. You need a pair of those. Search online with the part# 306106 and 306105.
You can easily find a pair for around $10.
* A Phillips screwdriver

## How long it takes to fix

30min

## Steps

* Unplug the main power cable and shut off the gas.

* This is a closer look. This is the coil cartridge.
* Replace coils. Watch [this video](http://youtu.be/tL5tH_hhvPk?t=1m8s) for 20sec
and follow the step7 and step8.
Basically, you just need to unplug 2 cables and
loosen 2 screws to reach the coils.
* Get back the panel.
* Done!

Hope this helps you!
