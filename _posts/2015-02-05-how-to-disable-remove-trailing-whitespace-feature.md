title: How to disable "Remove Trailing Whitespace" feature in Atom editor
---

By default, when you save a file on the Atom editor,
Atom kindly removes all the trailing whitespaces in each line.
Sometimes it is really helpful,
but sometimes (actually, most of times for me) it is really annoying because it makes a lot of diffs
especially if you work on something source controlled.


## How to disable it

![Preference](/public/images/16455138375_ac2090bbe2_z.jpg)

- Open "Preference" from the menu.
- Click "Packages" on the left.
- Type in "whitespace" at "Installed Packages" textbox
- Click "Settings" of the "whitespace" package

- Uncheck "Remove Trailing Whitespace" checkbox.


That's it! Hope this helps you.
