Since its release, [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) is getting better and better and
eventually it became my main editor now. Here are my favorite Atom packages
and themes that grabbed my heart.


### Vim Mode

[Vim Mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode) is a package that enables
the vim key bindings. Since I'm a vi originated person, this is a killer for me.
It works pretty smooth, and it really makes my life a lot easier.

### Minimap

[Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) is a package that gives you
the preview of the source code in the right hand side. This is one of the
very popular features in [Sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
Before installing this package, actually I was thinking that it didn't help that much
for me, but it turned out it was totally wrong.
I found I remember the code by its shape
and it helps me a lot to find out what I'm looking for.


### Monokai

[Mokokai](https://atom.io/themes/monokai) is a syntax theme.
There are quite a few syntax themes available at the Atom theme repository
and I just liked this one.
