Microsoft recently released a new editor called ["Visual Studio Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
Unlike the traditional heavyweight IDEs such as VisualStudio, 
it is just a lightweight code editor like Sublime or Atom. 
It supports node.js, javascript, HTML, CSS and other web technologies
as well as C#. It also has a git support. 
It runs on not only Windows, but on Mac and Linux also, which is great. 


The reason why it can run on multi platforms is because it is
based on 
[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) technology, 
formally called Atom shell. 
Since Microsoft has its own browser technology such as IE or Edge,
I'm really intereted in why they didn't pick those in-house technology but 
went with one originally from Google.


Anyway, I spent a couple of hours to check this new editor,
and so far I really like it.
The best part is, it is really lightweight and quick. 
Scrolling is very smooth even with a huge file, 
it doesn't slow down even if you open a folder including
a lot of files and folders in it. UI is simple and easy.


The only missing thing for me is the vi keybindings :)
This is the only reason I still cannot leave away from Atom. 


Visual Stuido Code currently doesn't have a plugin capability yet
but it is planned according to the [forum](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code).
Once it is implemented, then I guess the vi keybindings will come
soon after that and I think that's the time I switch to use Visual Studio Code.
